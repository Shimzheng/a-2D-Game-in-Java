# a-2D-Game-in-Java

Project1 used Java to develop an Object Oriented Program, in which the users can issue particular commands to configure the game, implement and render a game world where the users can control their player to move around the map, trigger a battle loop when the player encounters the monster, handle collision and damage.

Project2 improved the structure and functions of the program, including setting the items that can be picked up by the player to achieve  level-up or recovering, class inheritance, letting player data files can be saved and loaded, etc.
